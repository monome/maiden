# maiden keybindings

## editor

maiden uses an embedded [ace editor](https://ace.c9.io/) and supports its default keybindings. 
a full list of default shortcuts can be found on the 
[ace wiki](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/Default-Keyboard-Shortcuts).  

a few useful ones include:

| mac | linux/win | action |
|:----|:-------------:| :------|
| ⌘ f | ctrl+f | find |
| ⌘ / | ctrl+/ | toggle comment |
| ⌘ d | ctrl+d | remove line |
| ⌘ shift d | ctrl+shift+d | duplicate line |

(note that these require the editor pane to have focus).   

vim and emacs modes are also supported (enabled via the configuration page).

## maiden actions

in addition, some  common maiden actions also have shortcuts.  in particular:

| mac | linux/win | action |
|:----|:-------------:| :------|
| ⌘ b | ctrl+b | toggle the file viewer sidebar |
| ⌘ e | ctrl+e | toggle the repl view |
| ⌘ ; | ctrl+; | open the configuration page |
| ⌘ s | ctrl+s | save script |
| ⌘ p | ctrl+p | run script |

with more to come!
